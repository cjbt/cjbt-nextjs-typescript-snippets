# cjbt-nextjs-typescript-snippets

---

This extension contains code snippets for NextJS with Typescript. It is a fork of https://github.com/swyxio/swyx-react-typescript-snippets which is another fork of https://github.com/infeng/vscode-react-typescript made by cjbt.

It contains no class component APIs, styled components, assumes you use synthetic default imports, has hooks and subjectively better prop scaffolding.

It does a bit more based on the principle that it is easier to delete than to type, and so that we have just 3 easy to remember snippets: `rfc`, `rhc`, `rsc`.

They also come default exported
